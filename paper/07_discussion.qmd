# Discussion

This dissertation set out to determine if a adapted Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) could produce superior 72-hour return intervals for volatile mid-cap Solana tokens. The evidence gathered confirms this hypothesis, demonstrating that the proposed QRF pipeline is not only statistically superior to established baselines but that its predictive advantages translate into demonstrable economic value. This section synthesises these findings by systematically addressing the research questions, explaining the methodological drivers of the model's success, and considering the study's implications, limitations, and avenues for future work.

## Addressing the research questions

**RQ1 (Accuracy).** Under the blocked rolling evaluation, the adapted QRF attains the lowest mean pinball loss in the lower quantiles τ∈{0.05, 0.10, 0.25}, remains competitive at the median, and tracks the upper tails closely (@fig-pinball-by-quantile-by-model). Pairwise Diebold–Mariano tests (HAC/HLN, FDR q≤0.10) corroborate these differences: QRF beats LightGBM on 10/19 tokens at τ=0.10 and 12/19 at τ=0.25, and 16/19 at τ=0.95; around τ=0.50 differences are small and rarely significant. These patterns persist across volatility regimes and tokens, supporting QRF’s superior distributional accuracy.

**RQ2 (Calibration and sharpness).** After post-hoc calibration, QRF’s 90 % intervals are near-nominal (≈ 0.87–0.89) with modest under-coverage at 80 % (≈ 0.76–0.78). LightGBM over-covers (≈ 0.79 at 80 %, 0.98–0.99 at 90 %), while LQR under-covers substantially (≈ 0.51 at 80 %, 0.62 at 90 %) (@tbl-cov-width; @fig-qrf-v3-reliability-global). For a fixed coverage, QRF’s bands are narrower than LightGBM’s (@fig-efficiency-scatter, @fig-coverage-by-model). Widths scale sensibly with state: the 90 % mean width is \~0.23–0.34 in quiet/mid regimes versus \~1.35 in volatile periods, preserving coverage without blunt widening in calm markets. Thus, QRF meets the dual criteria of calibration and sharpness across tokens and regimes.

**RQ3 (Trading utility).** To test whether statistical gains translate into economic value, QRF-derived intervals feed two risk-aware sizing rules. Policy A (risk-scaled) sets exposure ∝ q₀.₅/|q₀.₁₀|, automatically de-gearing when the lower-tail widens. Policy B (thresholded) takes full size only when the 80 % interval is directional. Net of costs, both policies produce positive risk-adjusted returns: Policy A 1.36% mean with Sharpe 0.86; Policy B 1.60 % with Sharpe 0.92. Policy A delivers a smaller max drawdown (≈ 0.16 %) via variance-aware sizing, while Policy B captures larger trends at the cost of higher volatility (Section Application; Fig. @fig-equity-portfolio; Table of summary stats). These results affirm that QRF’s statistical edge converts to economic value under disciplined position sizing.

## Why QRF performs well

QRF’s success is not accidental but a result of an architecture uniquely suited to the problem’s asymmetry and non-stationarity. Its non-parametric splits capture heteroskedastic, interaction-rich structures without the symmetric-residual assumptions that limit linear models. Terminal-node empirical distributions yield direct conditional quantiles, a crucial advantage in heavy-tailed markets. This flexible learner is embedded in a robust time-series pipeline: time-decay weights prioritise recent data; regime-aware residual offsets correct tail miscalibration; isotonic rearrangement enforces logical consistency; and split-conformal bands provide finite-sample coverage guarantees. This integrated design is what yields the model's superior tail accuracy, near-nominal coverage, and adaptive widths.

## Baseline contributions

While QRF dominates on tail accuracy and efficiency, baselines retain niche utility. LightGBM + conformal is suitable where conservative over-coverage is policy-preferred, accepting wider intervals. LQR is competitive at τ=0.50 and offers interpretability via coefficients, but its systematic under-coverage limits tail-risk control. A pragmatic hybrid uses QRF for tails and LQR (or a boosted median) at τ=0.50 to combine robustness with interpretability.

## Robustness and generalisability

Sensitivity checks show qualitative stability: removing split-conformal induces systematic 80 % under-coverage; disabling time-decay inflates widths and raises median pinball; isotonic enforcement removes rare inversions and reduces fold-to-fold variance; half-life choices in \[30, 90] bars leave conclusions unchanged. The advantage stems from the QRF quantile mechanism plus light, state-aware calibration, not a tuning artefact. Generalisability beyond the study window and to neighbouring ecosystems (e.g., Arbitrum/Polygon) remains an avenue for validation.

## Limitations and threats to validity

Data incompleteness (intermittent on-chain/market feeds), survivorship/listing bias, timestamp misalignment across sources, and serial dependence from overlapping 72-hour targets all pose risks. Regime labels are approximate, and conformal guarantees are marginal rather than fully conditional, so pockets of conditional under-coverage may persist. Backtests simplify execution frictions (venue fragmentation, latency/MEV, borrow, impact). Finally, QRF’s local nature requires ongoing retraining and calibration monitoring under distribution shift.

## Practical value and deployment

Calibrated QRF intervals are directly actionable. Risk-scaled sizing de-gears when uncertainty widens and scales when intervals are directional, improving Sharpe and drawdown. Beyond trading, the lower-tail quantile serves as a forward-looking Value-at-Risk proxy; interval width provides a dynamic risk budget; and extreme misses beyond q05/q90 can trigger regime-shift alerts. A pragmatic rollout is: (i) shadow mode with coverage drift alarms, (ii) limited-risk deployment with caps/kill-switches, (iii) K-fold cross-conformal recalibration, (iv) integration of execution models (venue mix, inventory/borrow, impact).

## Synthesis and future directions

The evidence supports all three RQs. QRF outperforms linear and boosted baselines on accuracy across quantiles and regimes, maintains near-nominal coverage with sharper bands, and, crucially, delivers economic value when its intervals inform risk-aware sizing. LightGBM remains useful where over-coverage is mandated; LQR contributes interpretability at the centre. The broader lesson: distribution-aware forests with light, state-aware calibration are a practical foundation for interval forecasting and risk management in turbulent crypto markets. Future work should pursue cross-conformal and conditional calibration, transportability to other ecosystems/time spans, and execution-aware integration under realistic frictions.
