### OHLCV Data Cleaning and Filtering Strategy {#sec-cleaning-strategy}

To ensure high-quality OHLCV data for tail-sensitive forecasting, a multi-step cleaning strategy was implemented. Tokens with insufficient history were dropped entirely. For stable but late-starting tokens, their time series were clipped to begin at the first valid data point. Intermittent gaps were filled using a limited forward-fill (max 2 periods) to preserve volatility structure, as this method was found to outperform more complex alternatives. A binary `was_imputed` flag was created for all imputed points. This rigorous approach maintains data integrity for rolling-window backtesting and avoids aggressive imputations that could distort tail risk estimates.

### Table A2: Comparison of Imputation Methods on Simulated Missing Data {#imp-table}

To select the optimal imputation strategy, several methods were benchmarked on the `close_usd` price series for the token `$WIF` with 5% of data points randomly removed to simulate missingness. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the imputed and true values was calculated for each method.

| Imputation Method | RMSE |
| :--- | :--- |
| k-NN Imputation (k=5) | 0.93970 |
| Forward-fill (limit=2) | 0.09185 |
| Kalman Smoothing | 0.09185 |
| **Linear Interpolation** | **0.06042** |

The results clearly indicate that **linear interpolation** achieves the lowest reconstruction error. Based on this empirical evidence, a hybrid strategy of linear interpolation supplemented with a limited forward-fill was adopted for the final data preprocessing pipeline.

### Table A2: Feature Dictionary {#feature-table}

The table below enumerates the key features engineered for the forecasting models. All features were calculated on a per-token basis using a `groupby` operation to prevent data leakage.
