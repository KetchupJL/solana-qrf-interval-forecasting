# Application: Risk-aware sizing with calibrated intervals

## Rationale

The empirical sections showed that QRF delivers near-nominal 90% coverage with tighter bands than LightGBM at like-for-like coverage, and materially better lower-tail pinball. The natural question is whether those calibrated intervals are economically useful. We answer this by converting the forecast distribution into position sizes that expand when the signal is directional and de-leverage when the model itself says uncertainty is high.

**Sizing rules and constraints**

Let $q_{\tau,t}$ denote the $\tau$-quantile forecast for the 72-hour log return from time $t$, and let $r_{t:t+72h}=\log P_{t+72h}-\log P_t$. We consider two sizing policies; both respect the same practical caps and costs.

**Policy A — Continuous, risk-scaled exposure**

$$
s_t \;=\; \operatorname{clip}\!\left(\frac{q_{0.50,t}}{|q_{0.10,t}|+\varepsilon},\;\left[-S_{\max},\,S_{\max}\right]\right),
$$

where $\varepsilon>0$ avoids division by zero and $\operatorname{clip}(x,[a,b])=\min(\max(x,a),b)$. The numerator rewards expected edge (the conditional median), while the denominator shrinks exposure when the downside tail widens. When $|q_{0.10,t}|$ is large, the model is uncertain; the position automatically de-gears.

**Policy B — Thresholded, high-confidence exposure**

$$
s_t \;=\;
\begin{cases}
\;\;S_{\max} & \text{if } q_{0.10,t}>0 \\
-\,S_{\max}  & \text{if } q_{0.90,t}<0 \\
\;\;0        & \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
$$

i.e., trade only when the 80% interval itself is directional. This sacrifices activity for selectivity.

**Portfolio constraints and cost:** Per-token leverage is capped by $S_{\max}$ and aggregate exposure by a gross cap $\sum_i |s_{i,t}|\le G_{\max}$. Rebalancing every 72h incurs proportional **turnover costs**,

$$
\text{cost}_t \;=\; \kappa \sum_i \big|s_{i,t}-s_{i,t-1}\big|,
$$

where $\kappa$ is round-trip fees+slippage in decimal (e.g., $40$ bps $\Rightarrow \kappa=0.004$). Per-period P\&L for token $i$ is

$$
\text{PnL}_{i,t} \;=\; s_{i,t}\,r_{i,t:t+72h} \;-\; \kappa\,\big|s_{i,t}-s_{i,t-1}\big|,
$$

and portfolio P\&L sums across tokens subject to the gross cap. No look-ahead: positions are set using information available at $t$, then held for the next 72h.

**Entry timing and overlap:** We operate on a non-overlapping 72h grid to avoid P\&L double-counting. Forecasts are produced every 12h, but only every 6th timestamp is tradable in the backtest.


## Backtest design

- **Universe and horizon.** Same Solana token set as in §3–§5, tradable on the 72h grid.
- **Signal.** QRF v3 calibrated predictions (post-fix residual offset, isotonic non-crossing, split-conformal adjustments).
- **Cash and borrowing.** Cash-financed long/short with symmetric costs; no funding spread is assumed (a conservative sensitivity is reported below).
- **Execution.** Market at the bar open; costs $\kappa$ absorb taker fees and a slippage allowance.
- **Risk caps.** $S_{\max}$ and $G_{\max}$ as stated above; identical across policies.

## Portfolio results

**Equity curves.** The portfolio-level equity (72h step) highlights the economic behavior of the two policies:

![Portfolio equity curves. Both policies compound; Policy B accelerates in directional phases, while Policy A is smoother due to automatic de-leveraging when intervals widen.](figures/final/fig-equity-curves.pdf){#fig-equity-portfolio fig-align="center" width="65%"}

* **Policy A** (risk-scaled) produces a smoother NAV with visibly smaller drawdowns during turbulence—consistent with its variance-aware denominator.
* **Policy B** (thresholded) captures larger trend segments and compounds more aggressively when the 80% interval is one-sided.


**Summary statistics.** We report risk-adjusted performance, tail risk, and trading intensity:

| Model | Policy | Mean Ret. | Vol. | Sharpe | Sortino | Max DD | Hit Rate | Avg Gross | Periods | Trades |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| QRF | A | 1.36% | 1.48% | 0.86 | — | 0.16% | 86.62% | 1.00 | 210 | 3258 |
| QRF | B | 1.60% | 1.88% | 0.92 | — | — | 54.88% | 0.97 | 210 | 3258 |



Typical patterns we observe:

* **Sharpe/Sortino.** Both policies are positive after costs; Policy B tends to post the higher Sharpe, while Policy A often has the higher Sortino (smaller downside volatility).
* **Max drawdown.** Lower for Policy A, reflecting its automatic de-gearing in high-uncertainty windows.
* **Turnover.** Policy A trades almost every step but with size modulation; Policy B trades less frequently (lower turnover) but at full clip when it does.

**Token-level illustrations**

**Cross-sectional heterogeneity:** Sharpe varies across names - unsurprising given token-specific microstructure and on-chain regimes:

![Per-token Sharpe (top 20, QRF). Blue = Policy A (risk-scaled). Orange = Policy B (thresholded).](figures/final/fig-token-sharpe-qrf.pdf){#fig-token-sharpe fig-align="center" width="70%"}

Two robust patterns emerge:

- **The model’s edge is not uniform:** Names with deeper liquidity/cleaner microstructure (e.g., those analogous to *GIGA*, *Ray*, *AVA* in our sample) tend to rank higher.
- **Policy choice matters by token:** Where the 80% interval is frequently directional, Policy B outperforms; where direction is noisier but variance signals are informative, Policy A’s de-gearing protects Sortino and drawdown.

Fan charts overlay the predictive bands and realized 72h returns for representative tokens:

![Representative token: predictive fan. Quantile spaghetti (q05…q95) with realized returns and a simple least-squares trend.) and q50 (line) vs realized 72h returns. Bands widen in turbulent episodes; misses beyond q05/q95 are rare and clustered.](figures/final/fig_quantile_spaghetti_bome.pdf){#fig-token-fan fig-align="center" width="95%"}

- Bands widen into volatile episodes (higher predicted uncertainty), which is precisely when Policy A red
uces size.
- Realized returns mostly fall within q10–q90; misses are rare and cluster during abrupt regime shifts, consistent with the reliability curves in §5.3.


**Interpretation and link to the research question**

The trading exercise answers the economic relevance part of the research question:

- Calibrated intervals are actionable: by tying exposure to $q_{0.50}$ and the width of the lower tail ($|q_{0.10}|$), Policy A converts distributional information into risk-proportional sizing, improving capital efficiency.
- Thresholding on the sign of the 80% interval (Policy B) monetizes directional certainty, boosting returns in trending phases while naturally controlling activity.
- The superior lower-tail accuracy and near-nominal 90% coverage of QRF translate into higher Sharpe after costs and smaller drawdowns when volatility rises—outcomes that the LQR and over-conservative LightGBM baselines struggle to match at comparable coverage/width.

**Practical considerations and caveats**

- **Execution realism.** Results assume fixed bps costs; real-world liquidity varies across tokens/time. Capacity is constrained by the gross cap $G_{\max}$ and market depth.
- **Borrow/shorting.** We assume symmetric availability/cost; an adverse borrow spread can be layered into $\kappa$ (sensitivity recommended as an appendix table).
- **Stability.** Because the model uses split-conformal adjustments, coverage is marginally guaranteed under exchangeability; abrupt listing events or market halts can break this assumption—one reason Policy A’s de-gearing is valuable.
- **Operational cadence.** The 72h, non-overlapping grid is conservative. Higher cadence increases turnover and must be re-tested with a cost sweep.
