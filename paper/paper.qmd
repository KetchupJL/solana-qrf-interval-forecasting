# Abstract


# 1. Introduction

Problem & motivation in DeFi.

Contribution overview and research questions.

Summary of results (one paragraph) and paper roadmap.


# 2. Literature Review

Quantile regression & interval forecasting.

Tree ensembles for quantiles (QRF vs boosting).

Conformal prediction & calibration.

Crypto return forecasting/tail risk.


# 3. Data & Features

Datasets (12‑h OHLCV, on‑chain, market context). Time span, token filters.

Preprocessing: alignment, imputation, winsorization, flags.

Engineered features (momentum, volatility, liquidity, on‑chain, cross‑asset).

Add a tidy table of variables here or place it in Appendix A if long.


# 4. Methods

Baselines: Linear Quantile Regression; LightGBM + residual bootstrap.

Core Model: Quantile Regression Forests + extras

Calibration: split conformal (CQR) with rolling calibration window.

Validation: rolling‑window CV (train 120 bars, test 30 bars), metrics (pinball, coverage, width), DM tests.


# 5. Results

## 5.1 Baselines

Summarise LQR and LightGBM performance; show tables/plots.

# 5.2 QRF Performance

Pinball per τ ∈ {0.05, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.95}.

Interval coverage vs nominal (50% and 90% intervals).

Widths and sharpness.

## 5.3 Statistical Comparison

DM tests vs. baselines; highlight significant improvements.

## 5.4 Calibration Diagnostics

Quantile calibration plot; coverage curves; reliability diagrams.

## 5.5 Ablations & Interpretability

Feature importance (permutation or built‑in); top‑k retrain.

Brief SHAP interpretation for median and tails (optional figure).


# 6. Discussion

What the results imply for interval forecasting on Solana.

When QRF excels vs. when boosting might be sharper; limits and regimes.

Practicality for risk‑adjusted sizing and tail‑risk control.


# 7. Limitations & Ethical Considerations

Data gaps, survivorship bias, regime shifts, backtest caveats.

Responsible use of models in markets.

# 8. Conclusion

Answer research questions; summarise improvements and future work.
