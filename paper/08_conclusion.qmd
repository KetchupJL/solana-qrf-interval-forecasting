## Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

This dissertation addresses the challenge of risk management in volatile cryptocurrency markets by shifting the focus from traditional point forecasts to robust interval forecasting. It evaluates whether an adapted Quantile Regression Forest (QRF) can produce superior 72-hour return intervals for a universe of mid-cap tokens within the Solana ecosystem, using data aggregated in 12-hour bars[cite: 194].

The proposed QRF, which incorporates time-decay weighting and a multi-stage, regime-aware calibration pipeline, is benchmarked against Linear Quantile Regression (LQR) and a LightGBM-Quantile model. Models are evaluated under a rigorous rolling cross-validation design (120/24/6 bars for train/calibrate/test) using key metrics of pinball loss, interval coverage, and width.

The results demonstrate that the adapted QRF delivers the lowest pinball loss, particularly in the risk-critical lower tails ($\tau \le 0.25$), and achieves near-nominal 90% interval coverage with significantly sharper bands than its peers. Crucially, this statistical superiority translates into demonstrable economic value. When applied to a risk-aware backtest, the QRF-derived intervals produce positive risk-adjusted returns after costs, confirming their trading utility. The study concludes that distribution-aware forests with state-aware calibration provide a practical and effective framework for improving decision-making in turbulent digital asset markets.
