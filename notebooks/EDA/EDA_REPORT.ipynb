    "- Determined that on-chain metrics (`holder_count`, `new_token_accounts`, `transfer_count`) were structurally missing before 2025-02-07 12:00 UTC by inspecting the first non-null timestamp per token.  \n",
    "- After aligning to the on-chain start date, performed a post-2025-02-07 missingness audit showing ~12–13 % OHLCV gaps, ~5–6 % on-chain gaps, and < 1 % in global market fields.\n",
    "  - Formed intervals [–z·σ, +z·σ] around zero and measured empirical coverage (fraction of returns inside) and average interval width.  \n",
    "  - On the test set, for each α, computed empirical coverage and mean interval width from the QRF quantile predictions.  \n",
    "  - Tabulated interval widths for Naïve vs. QRF at key coverage levels.  \n",
    "- **Sharper intervals:** At α = 0.80, QRF intervals are narrower (avg. width 0.1682) than Naïve intervals (0.2038), achieving better sharpness at the same nominal level.  \n",
