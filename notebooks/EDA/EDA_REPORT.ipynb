    "- Removed any remaining rows with missing OHLCV values, ensuring a fully observed OHLCV history.\n",
    "- Validated that zero missing values remained in the core OHLCV fields after imputation.\n",
    "- Annotated every imputed row with a `was_imputed` flag for downstream diagnostics.\n",
    "- Restricted use of `holder_count` to timestamps ≥ 2025-02-07, when on-chain data collection began.\n",
    "To characterize gaps in the raw 12 h OHLCV and on‐chain tables, identify token‐ and feature‐level missingness patterns, and determine which tokens or rows to drop, clip, or impute before any feature engineering.\n",
    "To benchmark how simple Gaussian “± z·σ” intervals perform on 12 h returns against non-parametric QRF-based quantile intervals, quantifying both coverage and sharpness improvements.\n",
    "- After cleaning and imputation, the core OHLCV panel is fully observed for all retained tokens, with zero residual gaps in `open_usd`–`volume_usd` fields.  \n",
    "- On-chain metrics only become available from 2025-02-07 onwards, leaving a ~2 month pre-start period with structural missingness; tokens like LAUNCHCOIN and TITCOIN remain unusable for on-chain features due to persistent 100 % and late-start gaps respectively.  \n",
    "- Global market tables (BTC/ETH prices, TVL, transaction counts) incur < 1 % missingness once forward-filled to the master 12 h index.\n",
    "- Both 12 h and 72 h log-returns exhibit pronounced right skew (≈ 0.67) and extreme kurtosis (≈ 27.7), confirming heavy tails that violate Gaussian assumptions. \n",
    "- Volatility clustering is evident from a slowly decaying ACF in |log-returns| up to lag 20, indicating persistent heteroskedasticity.  \n",
    "- Extreme collinearity was found between token price and volume (r ≈ 0.999), and between BTC close and TVL (r ≈ 0.94), as well as SOL close and TVL (r ≈ 0.89).  \n",
    "- Naïve Gaussian ± z·σ bands systematically under-cover: the nominal 90 % interval covers only ~82 % of 12 h returns, and the 50 % band covers ~40 %.  \n",
    "- QRF-derived quantile intervals substantially close this gap: at α = 0.80 they achieve near-nominal coverage with narrower average width (0.1682 vs 0.2038 for Gaussian) using just four basic features.\n",
    "- Rolling split-conformal adjustments around QRF produced negative δ values and overly narrow bands, leading to catastrophic under-coverage (e.g. 80 % intervals covering only 20 %–36 % of returns) across all regimes.  \n",
    "  - **Tail‐risk & distributional features:** incorporate rolling 6-bar skewness/kurtosis because 12 h returns exhibit right‐skew (~0.67) and extreme kurtosis (~27.7).  \n",
    "  - **Mean‐reversion signals:** include lag-1 return and naïve forecast error after detecting strong negative autocorrelation at lag 1 in notebook 02.  \n",
    "  - **Market‐context composites:** replace raw SOL/BTC/TVL with a PCA or aggregate factor because BTC vs TVL (r≈0.94) and SOL vs TVL (r≈0.89) are highly collinear.\n",
    "  - **On‐chain feature windowing:** use holder_count, new_accounts and transfer_count only post-2025-02-07 and drop LAUNCHCOIN/TITCOIN as advised by notebook 01.\n",
    "  - **Gaussian baseline suffices only for sanity checks:** notebook 04 showed ± z·σ under-coverage (90 %→~82%); use it strictly as a lower bar.  \n",
    "  - **QRF as core benchmark:** direct quantile estimates in notebook 04 achieved near-nominal coverage and sharper intervals (0.1682 vs 0.2038 at α=0.80), and expand to the full feature set.  \n",
