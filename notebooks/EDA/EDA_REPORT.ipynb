    "  - **QRF as core benchmark:** direct quantile estimates in notebook 04 achieved near-nominal coverage and sharper intervals (0.1682 vs 0.2038 at \u03b1=0.80)  expand to full feature set.  \n",
    "  - **LightGBM residual\u2010bootstrap:** include as a second non-parametric comparison given its complementary modeling biases.  \n",
